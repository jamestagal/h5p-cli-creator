          These are the simplest true/false questions - just a statement and an answer.
          No extra features, just the basics.

      # Minimal example - just question and correct answer
      - type: truefalse
        question: "The Sun is a star"
        correct: true

      # Another basic example
      - type: truefalse
        question: "The Earth is flat"
        correct: false

      # Using optional title
      - type: truefalse
        title: "Geography Fact"

    content:
      - type: text
        title: "Providing Explanations"
        text: |
          You can provide custom feedback messages that appear when users answer correctly or incorrectly.
          This helps reinforce learning by explaining why an answer is right or wrong.

      # Custom feedback on wrong answer
      - type: truefalse
        title: "Solar System Size"
        question: "Earth is the largest planet in our solar system"
        correct: false
        behaviour:
          feedbackOnWrong: "Jupiter is actually the largest planet in our solar system! It's more than 11 times wider than Earth."

      # Custom feedback on correct answer
      - type: truefalse
        title: "Planet Rotation"
        question: "Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours"
        correct: true
        behaviour:
          feedbackOnCorrect: "Correct! This rotation gives us day and night cycles."

      # Both correct and wrong feedback
      - type: truefalse
        title: "Moon Facts"
        question: "The Moon has its own light"
        correct: false
        behaviour:
          feedbackOnCorrect: "That's right! The Moon reflects sunlight; it doesn't produce its own light."
          feedbackOnWrong: "Actually, the Moon doesn't have its own light. It reflects sunlight, which is why we can see it."
