Plants use sunlight, absorbed by chlorophyll in their leaves, along with carbon dioxide from the air and water from their roots. Through this process, they produce glucose (a sugar that provides energy) and release oxygen as a byproduct. This process is essential for life on Earth as it provides food for plants and oxygen for other organisms."

          sample: "The scientific method is a systematic process scientists use to investigate questions and acquire knowledge. It begins with observation of a phenomenon, which leads to asking a specific question. Next, scientists form a hypothesis - an educated guess about what might be happening. They then design and conduct experiments to test this hypothesis, carefully collecting data and measurements. After analyzing the results, scientists draw conclusions about whether their hypothesis was supported or not. Finally, the process is repeated by other scientists to verify the results. Each step is important: observation identifies what to study, the hypothesis provides direction, experiments gather evidence, data provides objective information, and conclusions help us understand the natural world. Replication ensures that results are reliable and not due to chance."

        solution:
          introduction: "A complete answer should describe the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), blood flow direction, gas exchange, and the connection to the respiratory system. Your wording may differ from this example."
          sample: "The human circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood throughout the body. At its center is the heart, a powerful muscle that pumps blood through a network of blood vessels. The system consists of three main types of vessels: arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body's tissues; capillaries are tiny vessels where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged with cells and carbon dioxide is picked up as waste; and veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. The blood then travels to the lungs, where it releases carbon dioxide and picks up fresh oxygen before returning to the heart to be pumped out again. This continuous circulation ensures that all cells receive the oxygen and nutrients they need while waste products are removed."
