          The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets and are made mostly
          of gases and liquids. Jupiter and Saturn are called gas giants, while Uranus
          and Neptune are ice giants.

            back: "The largest planet in our solar system. It has a Great Red Spot - a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter has at least 95 known moons!"

          - front: "Saturn"
            back: "Famous for its beautiful rings made of ice and rock particles. Saturn is the second-largest planet and could float in water because it's less dense!"

          - front: "Uranus"
            back: "An ice giant that rotates on its side. It appears blue-green due to methane in its atmosphere. It has 27 known moons."

          - front: "Neptune"
            back: "The farthest planet from the Sun. It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds up to 2,100 km/h. Its blue color comes from methane."

          The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust.
          At its center is the Sun, a star that contains 99.86% of the system's total mass.

          There are 8 planets in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

          The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are rocky terrestrial planets. Mercury is closest to the Sun.
          Venus is Earth's twin in size but has extreme temperatures. Earth is unique with liquid water and life.
          Mars is the Red Planet due to iron oxide on its surface.

          The outer planets are much larger gas and ice giants. Jupiter is the largest with a Great Red Spot storm.
          Saturn has beautiful rings of ice and rock. Uranus rotates on its side and appears blue-green.
          Neptune is the farthest planet with the strongest winds in the solar system.
