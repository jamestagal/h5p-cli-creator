          Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar (glucose).

          This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain chlorophyll - the green pigment that absorbs light energy.

          The overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

          This means six molecules of carbon dioxide plus six molecules of water, using light energy, produces one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.

          Photosynthesis has two main stages: the light-dependent reactions (which occur in the thylakoid membranes) and the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle (which occur in the stroma).
